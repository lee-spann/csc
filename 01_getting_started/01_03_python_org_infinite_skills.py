#infinite skills

# My end goal is to be very familiar with python and be able to code a game or program in python.
# Maybe code a fighting game like marvel vs. capcom or street fighter.
# I've had some expierence coding in the past like simple stuff on code .org and scratch snd unity but I really want to get familiar with python.
# If I could create one more thing it would be an emulator, I like to play video games so it makes sense.
# Another thing I would find cool to make would be an open world game, something like elden ring or god of war.
# Im very excited to see what python has to offer and all the cool things Ill be able to code.
