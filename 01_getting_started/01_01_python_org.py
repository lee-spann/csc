# In general I find coding very interesting and I am ready to learn anything python has to offer.
# I've had some experience in the past but im ready to level up my skills.
# I've had some eperience with unity, scratch, and code.org, so im interested in seeing how python differs and is similar.
# This is my first line of python code ever.
