# Some problems I could solve with my new found coding knowledge
# is detection. In almost every game there is a type of detection
# system, whether its with shooting games, fighting games, 
# scary games, conditionals now gives me an idea on how I would 
# code a game like those. Also lists, very helpful code, I can see
# myself using it when it comes to keep scores, or anything really.
# I can really feelm myself becoming a better coder after I complete 
# every assignment. I cant wait til the day where I out grown the book
# and start doing way more complex problem solving and coding.
